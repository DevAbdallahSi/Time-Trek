# ⏳ TimeTrek - Slice of Time

**A service to take back control of your time.**

## 🚀 Overview

**TimeTrek** is a smart, personalized time management web application that helps you make the most of your free time. Instead of falling into time-draining distractions, TimeTrek offers thoughtful, mood-aware suggestions based on your goals and the time you have.

Whether you're feeling energetic or relaxed, and whether you have 10 minutes or an hour — TimeTrek helps you use that slice of time meaningfully.

## 🧠 Idea Behind TimeTrek

Too often when we find ourselves with a small window of free time, we default to scrolling on social media or doing something unproductive. TimeTrek aims to replace that instinct with purpose-driven, personalized suggestions.

- 🎯 Users define their **personal goals**
- ⌛ Enter **free time available**
- 😊 Select their **current mood**
- 🤖 The app suggests a **goal-aligned activity**, using an AI model running on the backend
